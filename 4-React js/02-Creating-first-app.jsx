// Creating our first react app using create-react-app


//  Component-based architecture of React:
//                                      In React, we create our app by dividing it into different components. We can create components of our app individually and can reuse them again and again. 


// we can structure and design your react components as per your choice

//                   Advantage of dividing our app into components:
//  1: We can reuse the component in the same or different app repeatedly. 
//  2: We can change the component of our app using Props and State.
//  3: It also makes it easier to find errors in a large set of your code.

// Letâ€™s begin creating our app:

// We can create React Application by writing the Code from Scratch, But it will only lead to wastage of our efforts, As we can Directly Use create-react-app Package.

// npm: It stands for Node Package manager. It helps in Installing Packages in NodeJS.

// We can use NPM to install React app on our computer globally. But, we would be using the create-react-app command only once. So, Using npm will only lead to the consumption of our hard disk storage capacity, and hence we will be using npx instead of npm.

// npx: It is an npm package that is expected to be run only once in a project. In short, it allows you to use the Package without downloading it.

// Write the following command in Your VS Code Terminal. 

// npx create-react-app textutils

// Textutils is the name of our app. After running the command, a folder named textutils will be created.

// Folder Structure of Textutils(Our React App):
// node_modules: 
//              It contains all the packages, which are used by React app.
// .gitignore:
//              It contains the files, which you do not want to push in Github.
// package.json:
//              Contains all the packages which are installed in Node modules.
// readme.md:
 //             It provides the basic info about your app.

//                  The two folders in which we are interested are :

// "public" folder:
//                 It contains an Index.html file.
// index.html: 
//            It is the main HTML file of our react app. This is the page that is displayed on starting our application. It has an empty div tag like this:

//  <div id="root"></div>
// Here, we will be rendering data from components available in the src folder with the help of JavaScript.

// "src" folder: 
//              Most of the time, we will be writing our code in the src folder. 

//              Two most important files in the src folder are:

// index.js:
//       This is the entry component of our app. It has the code of what to render and where.
// app.js:
//       With the help of Index.js, the content and changes in it are delivered to the mentioned element.


//                        =====> How to run your React app?
// In index.js, open the terminal and write npm start, and your react app will be served at localhost:3000. You can make changes to the content of your React app in App.js. You can use npm run build if you are creating an app for production.
