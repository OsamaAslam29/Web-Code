Writing in-browser JavaScript and Developer Console | Web Development Tutorials #47
In this tutorial, we will see How to write JavaScript and what are the methods to write it. We will make a new file as tut46.html and add an instant boilerplate to get the basic HTML code to get started. Then give the title as JavaScript Tutorial under the <title> tag.

The next step is to add the HTML code in the body. We will add the container and a simple paragraph as shown below, just to understand the concept of JavaScript.

<body>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <p>
                This is a row in this container
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
The result of the above code will look as follows-



However, our main focus in this tutorial is to understand JavaScript. Therefore, we will not do any styling or add CSS here.

 


We have two options to place the JavaScript in the code. One is in the <head> section and the other is after the <body> tag. But if we view other professional websites, they place their JavaScript at the end of the <body> tag so that the DOM does not get affected. The basic code of JavaScript is as follows-

<script>
        //Write your js here
        console.log('Hello world');
        
    </script>
If we open the console section of the browser, we can see the output of the above code as shown below-



Console is the only place, where you will find all the errors made in the code. If you have locked any request or have applied AJAX in the code, the errors regarding all these things will be shown in the console tab itself. Also, we can see the values of different variables if written in the code. Although there may be a chance that if you are using any other browser apart from Chrome like Firefox or Safari, you may find a different console tab, the high-level ideas of all the browsers will be the same. Therefore, it is recommended to use the Chrome browser due to its high developer tools.

So I believe you must have got some basic ideas about JavaScript and the developer console provided by the browser. Furthermore, in the tutorials, we will see some advanced features of JavaScripts and how to make a professional website with a hamburger icon on it. To learn more about JavaScript stay with the tutorials.
