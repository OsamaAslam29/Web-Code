                                * JavaScript is a client side scripting language.
                         
                                * It is used to make web pages alive.
                         
                                * It is used to  perform actions within the page programmatically.
                         
                                When JavaScript was created, it was initially called “LiveScript”.
                         But Java was a very popular language at that time, so it was decided that positioning a language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.
                         
                                                     *******  What JavaScript can do?    *******
                         
                                  *  JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server.
                         
                                  *  We will use JavaScript as a client as well as server side language.
                         
                               JavaScript has evolved greatly as a language and is  used to perform different tasks.

                                     * JavaScript can add new HTML and change existing HTML from DOM.
                         
                                     * It can even react to any events (actions).
                         
                                     * It can also manage the AJAX requests (GET or POST request)
                         
                                     * JavaScript can get and set cookies and use local storage.

                                        * JavaScript cannot read or write to and from computer hard disk without user permissions. 
                         
                                        * The browser does not allow the JavaScript of any website to collect the AJAX information of the other website because it generates the error of  same origin policy.
                         
                                        * JavaScript can only access the permitted resources but cannot access your documents on personal computers. 
                         
                                       * These strict policies are developed to make sure that your computer is safe.

                                       * The most important thing that makes it a unique language is, it has a complete integration of HTML and CSS. 
                         
                                       * it provides the use of simple APIs (Application Programming Interface).
                         
                                       * It also supports the major modern browsers which are enabled by default. If you turn off the feature of JavaScript in the browser, you cannot access any website.
