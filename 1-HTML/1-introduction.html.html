    HTML :

         HTML is used as a standard language for any website design. It acts as a skeleton to a web application. Itâ€™s a well-standardized system.
    
     CSS :    
         CSS is used to handle the presentation of the web page. It makes the website look attractive and beautiful.

    JavaScripet :   
                JavaScript allows scripting on your website and makes it completely dynamic in nature. It provides front end scripting for your website and is a high-level dynamic interpreted programming language.


                Now, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have a lot of concepts in them which we will take over through the span of this course. Therefore, it cannot be learned all at once. If you are a beginner, learning HTML up to 80%, CSS up to 40-60%, and JavaScript up to 50-70% will be more than enough to start building websites. This is something nobody in the web development industry talks about and hence I thought to share this personal advice with all of you.  Please don't get me wrong when I say that. Once you have learned and understood the bare minimum to build a website you can come back to the course and start watching it once again for perfecting and sharpening the already learned concepts. Sometimes following this practice gets difficult, the good news is that once you start watching these videos and get your hands dirty with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the rest you will gradually learn based upon your practices and experiences with the help of projects I have designed as a part of this course. You need to learn all the concepts simultaneously and co-relate all the things by practicing them. -->
