     We  will  learn about how to write HTML code in the Visual Studio Code.

It is a free open source IDE from Microsoft which makes our work a lot easier.  Make a folder named “Complete Web development ” and then open VS Code in that folder by pressing right-click > Open with code. In case, you can’t find the option of opening the particular folder with Visual Studio, you can restart your PC or laptop to make sure that changes have taken place after you installed VS Code.

“index.html” is an example of a very simple HTML file in which we make further changes to make it look professional. Although you can write all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes in Notepad, I’ll not recommend doing so. This is because in Notepad you have to make different files and edit them one by one and also it does not provide the option of syntax highlighting. And, I would recommend using the Chrome Browser due to its nice functionality and amazing dev tools. 

One of the most important extensions that I would recommend to install is Live Server. After installing it, refresh the Visual Studio Code and click on the Go Live option in the right bottom. The advantage we get by using this extension is that it automatically makes changes in the web page whatever you write in the HTML code.

There are two types of settings options in the Visual Studio Code. The first set of settings is the user settings which are used to manage the user and whole VS code. The second set is the Workspace settings which is for only the particular workspace (opened folder) in which you are currently working. You can also change the keyboard shortcuts according to your needs to make your work efficient.

So these are some basic knowledge and tips about the Visual Studio Code. I hope you have understood all the concepts very easily. The software works the same in macOS and Linux.
